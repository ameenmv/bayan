Create a professional and elegant “About Us” web page for Al-Bayan Academy for Quran Learning and Sciences.

🖼️ Note: I will add the academy’s official logo manually, so leave a placeholder space for it in the header.

Use the same color palette as in the reference image:

Deep Green #2E4A40

Golden Beige #D9B45E

Light Cream Background #F9F7F2

White and soft gray for clarity and contrast.

🕌 Theme: Islamic, Educational, Elegant, and Trustworthy.
🎨 Font Style: Use an Arabic-style heading font (e.g., Amiri, Scheherazade) and a clean sans-serif for body text.
